var welcomeMessage = "Hello, my name is Bob. I am graduating from Hope College in December with a degree in Computer Science. I am a developer in search of a full time developing job.  I originally graduated from Hope four years ago with a degree in Secondary Education.  However, I found my way into programming by experimenting with micro controllers and knew that I wanted to make that my life's work.  I decided to return to Hope College to pursue a degree in Computer Science with a focus in software development.  I have never looked back.  Take a moment and look over my resume, browse some of my side projects, and get to know me a little better.  Thank You!";

I am a passionate developer and all-around tech nerd.  When I'm not with my kids chasing our dogs around the yard, I'm probably in my \"office\" programming a Raspberry Pi to turn my smart light bulbs red.  I love this line of work and I cannot wait to discuss it more with you.",
    "full" : "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspI have been trying to grow up in Holland my entire life.  I went to Holland Christian schools for my k-12.  I met my wife, Elyse, there.  After Graduating high school in 2009 I attended Hope College.  Freshman year at Hope I spent studying Civil Engineering.  After deciding that engineering was not for my I switched into Education.  I love teaching and sharing my passions with others.  I graduated in 2013 with my bachelor's in Social Studies Secondary Education.  I still love teaching and sharing my passions with students, but being a career educator never meshed with my life well.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I had loved building computers and exploring technology since childhood.  I was first introduced to programming in my Intro to Engineering class at Hope my freshman year.  We programmed Arduino's in C for a project.  After college I began experimenting with coding and, started my unnatural love affair with raspberry pi's.  I was hooked immediately and knew what I had to do. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I decided to return to Hope and pursue a degree in Computer Science focusing on software development.  Programming combines the technical challenges that I loved from engineering, with a more human and creative approach that I was drawn to by Social Studies.",
